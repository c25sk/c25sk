<body>what you have leared so far â€” about bout the structure and syntax of html and css, about how coding has made you feel so far, the terminal and the graphical user interface

So far, I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and coding in general. The biggest thing I have learned is that coding requries very specific inputs to make sure what you code does what you intend. I also learned that if something doesn't work, there is probably a very good reason like forgetting a semi-colon or bracket. <br>
Its very exciting writing things down on an empty sheet and seeing it come to life on a website. Coding has made me feel exciited, but also confused at times and everytime I do something, I know there is a lot more to learn and imrove. <br>
I also learned about what computers and interfaces used to be like before the invention of a GUI. Its hard to believe that all computers looked like the terminal and you had to manually type in each action. I found it interesting how Xerox's lack of capitalization on their new idea lead to some of the biggest companies in the world today
