<strong>Journal Entry #1 </strong><br>

Q: What you have leared so far â€” about bout the structure and syntax of html and css, about how coding has made you feel so far, the terminal and the graphical user interface <br>
<br>
So far, I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and coding in general. The biggest thing I have learned is that coding requries very specific inputs to make sure what you code does what you intend. I also learned that if something doesn't work, there is probably a very good reason like forgetting a semi-colon or bracket. <br>
	<br>Its very exciting writing things down on an empty sheet and seeing it come to life on a website. Coding has made me feel exciited, but also confused at times and everytime I do something, I know there is a lot more to learn and imrove. <br>

<br>I also learned about what computers and interfaces used to be like before the invention of a GUI. Its hard to believe that all computers looked like the terminal and you had to manually type in each action. I found it interesting how Xerox's lack of capitalization on their new idea lead to some of the biggest companies in the world today

<strong>Journal Entry #2 </strong><br>
Throughout the class I have also learned that what you write and where you write it is very important. Every piece of text matter, especially semi colons. I also learned that it takes a while to figure out why things are working, and it is possible to solve things on your own. <br>
<br>
<strong>Journal Entry #3 </strong><br>
I think my code works because it follows the program is was written in to. If it didn't follow the specific syntax of the coding language, it wouldn't have worked. I chose to make the animation I did because it was simple, but also demonstrated my ability to make one. I also liked the colors that it was changing too and how it looped around the entire screen and not just one corner. <br>
